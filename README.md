Key Features:
-Random player generator from an available pool of popular players.

-When player is selected data is retrieved from an external library
-The data that is required for the game is in 2 seperate locations in the library so there are 2 retrievals that happen.

-Slick API used to present the gathered data on a carousel.

-Font Awesome API used to replace the standard slick navigation buttons with better looking buttons that are animated.

-Sweet Alert API used for the wrong/correct notification with actions associated to the presented buttons.

-Video embedded into the page from youtube with controls.

How to Use:
-Simple to use game that involves reading the instructions posted at the top of the page. The instructions will explain that all of the answsers will be from the NBAs list of top 100 players for 2021(the most recent season).

-Following the instructions you simply hit the button that says "good luck".

-Your hints will be generated and you can click through them to gather more information on your mystery player.

-When you think you know the answer you can type the name into the input field and hit the submit button (capitalization does not matter but spelling does).

-If you get it wrong you will be able to guess again.

-When you get the question right you may play again or watch the NBA Highlights video embedded in the page as a reward.

Lessons Learned:
-Manipulating elements added with an API through CSS is much more difficult than elements created locally.

-API research is key before selection because multiple APIs may have basically the same function but the custimazation options may be drastically different or there may be a lack of documentation making things very difficult to manipulate.

-Building a endstate before starting would be extreamly helpful as opposed to just implimenting functions as they come to mind. Lack of a proper plan caused a lot of pivots in focus and work ending up going to waste.

-I have no clue how to use API keys

Functions to Add:
-Score tracker for each play and for a highscore by name.

-autoplay function for the video when you select that you want to watch it.

-selecting watch highlights will signal for a video of the correct answers highlights to play as opposed to the single embedded NBA highlights video.
